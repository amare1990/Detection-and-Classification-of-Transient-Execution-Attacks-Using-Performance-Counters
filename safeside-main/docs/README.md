# Documentation and resources

We hope to keep this list of references up-to-date, improve taxonomy and classification, and expand the references to include a brief overview of the novel aspects of each attack.

<!--

What link to use for a given reference?

Prefer the first of:
- An arXiv.org abstract
- A website with an obvious link to a paper
- A link to the paper itself
